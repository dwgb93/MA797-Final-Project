# MA797-Final-Project
Machine Learning final project: animal image classification using transfer learning. But with a twist!

Note: This was technically a group project, but I did all of the coding, almost all of the writing, and was the only member to present. To not throw my other team-members under the bus, their names have been removed.

Check out the linked Google Colab Notebook or the final paper to get a better sense of why this project was much more difficult than it may seem.
